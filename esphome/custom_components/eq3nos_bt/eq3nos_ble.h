 * @brief BLE transport layer for EQ3 valves.

 * - connection lifecycle (connect/disconnect)
 * - GATTC event handling and notification enabling (CCCD)
 * - sending raw messages and forwarding notifications to the application layer
 * - command serialization via a FreeRTOS queue + watchdog
 *
 * The EQ3 protocol parsing/encoding is handled by the protocol layer (EQ3Control).
